#This program creates a list of 100 random items and inserts a random
#number into a random index. It then makes the unsorted list a sorted
#list. 

#It then needs to repeat this process until we have a list of 10,000 items with a random number inserted in that list 
#at one point or another 

#Then it needs to print out how long it took to insert a random number into each of the one hundread lists.
